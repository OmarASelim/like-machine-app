# Like Machine

## Demo

You can a check a demo version of the [app](https://like-machine-app.herokuapp.com) 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.

`Verify that you are running at least Node.js version 8.x or greater and npm version 5.x or greater by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.`

### Installing

* Clone this repositry `git@github.com:omarabdel-hady/like-machine-app.git`
* CD to the folder `cd FOLDER_NAME`
* Run `yarn` to install project dependencies.

`Although npm install would also work, its recommended to use Yarn to install the app dependencies. Yarn has the big advantage that if you use it you will be installing the exact same dependencies than I installed in my machine, so you wont run into issues caused by semantic versioning updates.`

## Development server

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` for a dev server. It will navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Built with
